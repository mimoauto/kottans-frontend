Learned the basic commands for working in the terminal. turned out to be very useful. Now it is necessary to consolidate everything in practice in order to sharpen the speed and store it well in the memory

It will be exciting if everything works out the first time

It was very interesting. Almost all things were new to me.

I realized that with the help of commands I can manage any process.

It will be very necessary in further work, especially with the terminal, when working with Git

## Git Collaboration

On the Coursera course, it was interesting and intelligibly explained the theory, and it turned out to be well consolidated in practice, on the learngitbranching.com website
